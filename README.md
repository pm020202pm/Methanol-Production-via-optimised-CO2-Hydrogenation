# Methanol-Production-via-optimised-CO2-Hydrogenation

Fossil fuels, including coal, natural gas, and oil, supply 80% of the world's energy and have powered the world's economies for over 150 years. However, burning fossil fuels releases CO2. A significant part of the scientific community believes that the buildup of CO2 in the atmosphere is closely linked to the rising global temperature. Utilizing the released CO2 as a raw material to produce a marketable product can lead to economic and environmental benefits.
Methanol is widely used in the chemical industry to produce formaldehyde, acetic acid, olefins, gasoline, etc. Most of the methanol is industrially produced by catalytically converting synthesis gas, which is a mixture of CO2, CO, and H2 derived from natural gas. Alternatively, methanol can be produced by the direct hydrogenation of CO2:

CO2 + 3H2 ⇔ CH3OH+ H2O

A process flow diagram is shown in Figure 1. The temperature and pressure of the inlet CO2 and H2 streams are 25 °C and 1 bar, respectively. The two gases are compressed to 78 bar by a series of compressors with coolers. The two streams are mixed with a recycle stream, heated to 210 °C, and fed to a reactor. The highpressure gases leaving the reactor are throttled through a valve to reduce the stream pressure to 72 bar and cooled to 40 °C. The stream then enters a flash drum, where a large fraction of unreacted CO2 and H2 in the vapor phase is separated from CH3OH and H2O in the liquid phase. A fraction of the vapor stream is purged, and the remaining is recycled to be mixed with the fresh stream of CO2 and H2. The pressure of the liquid stream from the flash drum is reduced to 1 bar, and another flash drum is employed to separate CO2 and H2. The liquid stream primarily contains CH3OH and H2O, which are separated using a distillation column. CH3OH is obtained in the overhead stream, and H2O in the bottom stream.
